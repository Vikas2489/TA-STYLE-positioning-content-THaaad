                    <h1>First large-scale bodybuilding competition</h1>
                    <p class="para1">Sandow organized the first bodybuilding contest on September 14, 1901, called the "Great
                        Competition". It was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London.[9] Judged by Sandow, Sir Charles
                        Lawes, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the contest was a great success and many bodybuilding
                        enthusiasts were turned away due to the overwhelming number of audience members. The trophy
                        presented to the winner was a gold statue of Sandow sculpted by Frederick Pomeroy. The winner
                        was William L. Murray of Nottingham. The silver Sandow trophy was presented to second-place
                        winner D. Cooper.

                        From December 28, 1903 to January 2, 1904,the first large-scale bodybuilding competition in
                        America took place at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The competition was promoted by
                        Bernarr Macfadden, the father of physical culture and publisher of original bodybuilding
                        magazines such as Health & Strength.. Treloar won a $1,000 cash prize, a substantial sum at
                        that time. Two weeks later, Thomas Edison made a film of Treloar's posing routine. Edison had
                        also made two films of Sandow a few years before. Those were the first three motion pictures
                        featuring a bodybuilder. In the early 20th century, Macfadden and Charles Atlas continued to
                        promote bodybuilding across the world.</p></div>
