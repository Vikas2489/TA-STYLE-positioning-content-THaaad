                    <p class="para1">De Asha was born in Liverpool, England in 1988. Here, he grew up in a poor neighborhood, where
                        his family was constantly struggling financially. It would be these struggles that would
                        eventually give him the drive to earn more money, and take care of his family. However, at the
                        time, he was forced to live on welfare and was left with limited options for his future.

                        Even though De Asha has found success boydbuilding, he actually started out playing soccer. He
                        played on a semi-pro team for around a decade, where he was a really good player. He would then
                        venture into the world of rowing. This was before he found his true passion for bodybuilding.

                        De Asha first turned to bodybuilding to gain muscle for soccer. Ironically enough, when he first
                        attended a gym, he found himself “intimidated” by the large athletes. However, he found his way
                        back, enjoying the feel of lifting free weights, along with gaining mass.

                        At this point, he would find himself immersed in materials about bodybuilding. He would read
                        books like ones written by Joe Weirder. This is where he started to really develop a love for
                        bodybuilding techniques. Subsequently, he started maintaining a stricter diet, which left him
                        gaining 45lbs of muscle in just 15 months.
                        Early Bodybuilding Career

                        Initially, De Asha did not have an interest in pursuing a career in bodybuilding. He felt as if
                        bodybuilding was not a sport,
