                        <h1>First large-scale bodybuilding competition</h1>
                        <p class="para1">Sandow organized the first bodybuilding contest on September 14, 1901, called
                            the "Great
                            Competition". It was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London.[9] Judged by Sandow, Sir
                            Charles
                            Lawes, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the contest was a great success and many bodybuilding
                            enthusiasts were turned away due to the overwhelming number of audience members. The trophy
                            presented to the winner was a gold statue of Sandow sculpted by Frederick Pomeroy. The
                            winner
                            was William L. Murray of Nottingham. The silver Sandow trophy was presented to second-place
                            winner D. Cooper.

                            From December 28, 1903 to January 2, 1904,the first large-scale bodybuilding competition in
                            America took place at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The competition was promoted
                            by
                            Bernarr Macfadden, the father of physical culture and publisher of original bodybuilding
                            magazines such as Health & Strength.. Treloar won a $1,000 cash prize, a substantial sum at
                            that time. Two weeks later, Thomas Edison made a film of Treloar's posing routine. Edison
                            had
                            also made two films of Sandow a few years before. Those were the first three motion pictures
                            featuring a bodybuilder. In the early 20th century, Macfadden and Charles Atlas continued to
                            promote bodybuilding across the world.</p>
